# bevy_2d_perspective
[WIP] A bevy custom material powered by a shader that allows for tilting a 2D sprite as if its in 3D space.

I made this just to grab the repo name. I have a working version of this in a game im creating, and will release it here as soon as its ready. Until then, feel free to message me on Discord (peepojuice). You can find me in the Bevy Discord server :)
